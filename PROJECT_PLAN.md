# AutoApply Gemini - High Level Project Plan

## üéØ Project Vision

An intelligent Chrome extension that uses Chrome's built-in Gemini Nano AI to automatically fill job application forms, making the job application process faster and more efficient while maintaining complete user control and transparency.

## üë§ User Experience Flow

### Phase 1: CV Setup (One-Time)

1. **Upload CV** - User uploads their resume (PDF, Word, or text)
2. **AI Extraction** - Gemini Nano extracts structured data (name, experience, skills, education, etc.)
3. **User Review & Edit** - User can directly edit any extracted field
4. **Save Master CV** - One comprehensive CV stored for all future applications

### Phase 2: Job Application (Per Application)

1. **Navigate to Job Site** - User goes to any job application page
2. **Job Description Capture** - Extension automatically captures and stores job description
3. **Page-by-Page Agent Auto-Fill** - For each page:
   - User clicks "Auto-Fill" button in side panel
   - Extension provides tools and context to Gemini Nano agent
   - Agent analyzes current form + job description + user's CV
   - Agent uses tools to fill form fields directly on the page
   - User sees filled form immediately (agent's work is visible)
   - User can edit any field directly on the page if needed
   - User clicks "Next" to proceed to next page
4. **Complete Application** - Repeat until application is complete
5. **Submit Application** - User submits final form

### Phase 3: Interview Preparation (Future Use)

1. **Get Interview Call** - User receives interview invitation
2. **Review Application** - User opens extension to view what they submitted
3. **Interview Prep** - User reviews complete application dump including:
   - Full job description
   - Exact responses submitted
   - How CV was tailored for this specific role
   - All personal information provided
4. **Prepare for Interview** - User knows exactly what the company has about them

## ü§ñ Gemini Nano Agent Architecture

### Agent Role

Gemini Nano acts as an **autonomous agent** that fills job application forms on behalf of the user. The agent receives tools and context, then makes intelligent decisions about what actions to take.

### Agent Tools (Provided by Extension)

1. **Form Analysis Tool** - Scan and understand form structure
2. **CV Access Tool** - Retrieve user's CV data
3. **Job Context Tool** - Get job description and requirements
4. **Field Fill Tool** - Fill text inputs and textareas
5. **Selection Tool** - Select dropdown options, radio buttons, checkboxes
6. **File Upload Tool** - Handle file uploads (resume, cover letter)
7. **Click Tool** - Click buttons and links
8. **Validation Tool** - Check if fields are filled correctly

### Agent Decision Process

1. **Receive Context** - Get form structure, CV data, and job description
2. **Analyze Requirements** - Understand what each field needs
3. **Plan Actions** - Decide which tools to use for each field
4. **Execute Actions** - Use tools to fill form fields
5. **Validate Results** - Check that actions were successful

### Agent Optimization for Gemini Nano

- **Tool-Based Approach** - Agent uses specific tools rather than general processing
- **Chunked Context** - Process form fields in small batches to fit context window
- **Focused Prompts** - Agent receives clear instructions about available tools
- **Action-Oriented** - Agent outputs specific tool calls rather than general text

### Agent Tool Interface

The agent receives a structured interface with available tools:

```
Available Tools:
- analyzeForm() - Get form structure and field information
- getCVData() - Retrieve user's CV information
- getJobContext() - Get job description and requirements
- fillField(fieldId, value) - Fill text input or textarea
- selectOption(fieldId, value) - Select dropdown or radio button
- uploadFile(fieldId, fileData) - Handle file uploads
- clickElement(elementId) - Click buttons or links
- validateFill(fieldId) - Check if field was filled correctly

Agent Output Format:
{
  "actions": [
    {"tool": "fillField", "fieldId": "name", "value": "John Doe"},
    {"tool": "selectOption", "fieldId": "experience", "value": "5-10 years"},
    {"tool": "fillField", "fieldId": "cover_letter", "value": "Generated response..."}
  ]
}
```
